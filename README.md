> ### This is a work in progress for adding the ability for multi image drag n' drop.

Forked from [adrotec/knockout-file-bindings](https://github.com/adrotec/knockout-file-bindings)

> I'll put a little more work into the README when I have made more progress. As for now this project might go backwards a bit on my fork, until I have something work showing off I will hold off on documentation and examples.
